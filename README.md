# Inventory Management System for Team Shutterbugs
This project was developed to ensure efficient and seamless management of camera equipment exchanged among the members of Team Shutterbugs during college festivals. Team Shutterbugs is the official Photography team of K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering. 

## Features
1. **Marking out equipment**: When a member takes some equipment for an event, the corressponding entry is made in the system. The camera body, lens, memory card, battery, etc. borrowed by the member as well as the event the member is going to can be entered into the system. 
2. **Marking in equipment**: When a member returns back from the event, the equipment is checked and marked as returned. In case anything is damaged, a comment can be added.
3. **Searching for equipment**: Search capability includes search by name, search by event, and search by equipment.
4. **Displaying logs**: The logs are displayed in a tabular format and stored in a text file for persistent storage.
